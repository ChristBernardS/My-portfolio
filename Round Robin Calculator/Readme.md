# Round-robbin calculator

Hi, this is my first project given by my lecturer. It was an app inspired by boonsuen where I see his/her project from https://boonsuen.com/process-scheduling-solver. In this program I used python version 3.11.6 because at the time it was the only version where I could convert the .py file into .exe file by using pyinstaller module. This is what the apps look liked. If you are interested in trying the app, please download the build and dist folder and calculator.spec file.
