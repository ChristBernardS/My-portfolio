Hi, this is my first project given by my lecturer. It was an app inspired by boonsuen where I see his/her project from https://boonsuen.com/process-scheduling-solver. In this program I used python version 3.11.6 because at the time it was the only version where I could convert the .py file into .exe file by using pyinstaller module. This is what the apps look liked.
